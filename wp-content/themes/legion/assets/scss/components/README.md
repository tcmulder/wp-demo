# About the Components Directory
The components SASS directory is the third to be loaded and contains the modules that actually make up the pageâ€”things like image grids, calls to action, contact forms, etc. Any collection of elements that makes up a distinct feature of the website is a candidate for its own file in the components directory. I use [SASS Globbing](https://github.com/chriseppstein/sass-globbing) so it's easy for me to drop new files into the directory without needing to edit the styles.scss imports.
